    "\n",
    "#### Get the work started\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to Terminal (Mac)/Command Prompt (Win).\n",
    "2. Navigate to the class floder `cd Documents/ECON46`/ `cd Documents\\ECON46` or whatever is the path in your own computer.\n",
    "3. Type `jupyter notebook`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Activating the virtual environment\n",
    "In general, if you are working with the notebooks you most likely will not need to activate it like this explicitly but in case you need it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to Terminal (Mac)/Command Prompt (Win).\n",
    "2. Navigate to the class floder `cd Documents/ECON46`/ `cd Documents\\ECON46` or whatever is the path in your own computer.\n",
    "3. Type `source econ46_virtual_env/bin/activate` (Mac)/ `econ46_virtual_env\\Scripts\\activate.bat` (Win)\n",

    "#### Deactivating the virtual environment\n",
    "1. Type `deactivate` in your CLI (Terminal/Command Prompt).Or just close all tabs of the CLI.\n",

    "#### Import python modules/packages\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, or in a notebook, type `import module_name as module_alias`, for instance: `import networkx as nx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most of the packages we use you can find all the imports at the begining of the notebooks (except in notebook 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using class-specific functions\n",
    "Some functions have been created specifically for the class. In the course notebooks they have the el. prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use them you need to import it as a package as well. As long as you have kept the folder structure as it was suggested on canvas then it only requires you to type `from supporting_material import econ46_library as el`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can access all functions in the file `Notebooks/supporting_material/econ46_library.py` by prepending the function name with `el.`\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance to read some file with an edgelist you can type `el.read_network_from_file(PATH_TO_FILE)`.\n",

You can play with this in the **network comparison widget** in notebook 2 but you can also take a look at the function and play directly with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use directly Networkx random network generator where you can also play with N, p and decide whether it is a directed or undirected network. Note: the seed allows you to control the randomness in the sense that if you want to replicate a simulation you did in the past or a simulation someone else did using this function you need to specificy the same seed.\n",

    "If you have a network object in python named G0. Then defining a list of seeding points you can simulate a contagion process with `el.contagion(G=G0,initial=[1,14])`. Make sure that 1 and 14 are indeed nodes in that network!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify other parameters like:\n",
    "- T, the number of periods you will allow the process to run (default is 5).\n",

    "- vaccinated, a list of nodes that are immune to the process (default is [] empty)\n",
