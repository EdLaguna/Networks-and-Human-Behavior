# Networks and Human Behavior
## Tools for computational analysis

This repository contains supporting materials and code for Econ 46 - Networks and Human Behavior- by Matthew O. Jackson.

To get started, you should go through the [Setup Guide](https://github.com/EdLaguna/Networks-and-Human-Behavior/blob/master/Notebooks/n0_python_setup.ipynb). It will help you to set up an environment where you can use the code provided in the class and generate your own analysis.
